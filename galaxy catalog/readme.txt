this code analize a ramdon group od galaxies and verify some of the well known relation between the key properties of galaxies, suche as mass and redshift.
the aim is to verify if this group follow the theoretical function used to describe galaxy quantities.

changing ID in the code change the galaxy used for statistic, also the slicing must be changed in order to avoid problem with outlier
